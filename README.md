# Invoice (formerly *Inco*)

Invoices and customers handling thing that I made to replace my awful system of a spreadsheet and directory of PDFs.

## Installation

Web server (I used Apache2), PHP 7, and some extensions:

| PHP extension | Apt package    |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| SQLite3       | php7.4-sqlite3 |

Your web server additionally needs write permission to the `/private/` directory.
